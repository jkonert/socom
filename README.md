# SoCom - the Social Communication Middleware

Ever wanted to connect your app to manifold social web applications? SoCom provides a middleware stub to mediate content exchange between your app and social media applications (like g+, fb, twitter..). Users create accounts within the middleware (white labeled if you like) and add/remove access rights to various social applications. Thus your app can simply access aggregated profile info and spread/post to various social hubs in the name of the user seamlessly.
