<p>Ever wanted to connect your app to manifold social web applications?
SoCom provides a middleware stub to mediate content exchange between your app and social media applications (like g+, fb, twitter..).
Users create accounts within the middleware (white labeled if you like) and add/remove access rights to various social applications. Thus your app can simply access aggregated profile info and spread/post to various social hubs in the name of the user seamlessly.</p>

<a id="the-innovative-aspect-of-influencial-activites-votesuploads-from-the-social-network-directly-streamed-into-your-app" class="anchor" href="#the-innovative-aspect-of-influencial-activites-votesuploads-from-the-social-network-directly-streamed-into-your-app" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The innovative aspect of influencial activites: votes/uploads from the social network directly streamed into your app.</h3>

<p>While the way from your app into the social media hubs is offered by many libraries/middlewares, SoCom offers a whole new way of using social hubs: You can integrate/design so called "influences". Peers of your user are asked to contribute votes, content, texts or place objects and you pull these contributions directly into the app experience of your current user.</p>

<p>SoCom makes this really easy by rendering a web-based influence interface for the friends of your user automatically.
You as a developer set the parameters, activate influences via API and pull the results.</p>
