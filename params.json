Thus your app can simply access aggregated profile info and spread/post to various social hubs in the name of the user seamlessly.\r\n\r\n### The innovative aspect of influencial activites: votes/uploads from the social network directly streamed into your app.\r\nWhile the way from your app into the social media hubs is offered by many libraries/middlewares, SoCom offers a whole new way of using social hubs: You can integrate/design so called \"influences\". Peers of your user are asked to contribute votes, content, texts or place objects and you pull these contributions directly into the app experience of your current user.\r\n\r\nSoCom makes this really easy by rendering a web-based influence interface for the friends of your user automatically.\r\nYou as a developer set the parameters, activate influences via API and pull the results.\r\n\r\n## Core Features\r\n* normalized user profile data - regardless from which social hub they are aggregated from\r\n* content publishing, e.g. from your game app to the social wall of your user\r\n* access to comments, likes etc.\r\n* pull of influences (content, votes) from the social network of your user\r\n* RESTful APIs for user account management, content distribution (even private storage) and pull of content from social hub\r\n* abstraction layer circumvention, e.g. for direct facebook-API statement injection\r\n\r\n### Why users will love it\r\n* Your app instantly supports use of all major social media apps supported by SoCom (and they will grow continuously)\r\n* They can feel the new personalized experience (e.g. in a game) when their social network friends contribute content to it.\r\n* They cann access and manage all content published, commented, contributed via the SoCom web-interface (no need to browse the whole fb, g+ history)\r\n* All SoCom using apps can share one account\r\n\r\n### Why developers will love it\r\n* user-account and app token management for access to social media apps simply via SoCom API\r\n* publish to feeds in the name of user - and don't care which social app it really is behind (g+, fb, ..)\r\n* offer influencial experiences to the social network of your user, attract attention and lead them to your product\r\n* offer your user a personalized (game)-experience by content/votes contributed by his friends\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contact us\r\nFurther questions or need specific features?
